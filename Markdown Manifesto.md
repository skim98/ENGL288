In the history of mankind, there have been billions of students. The notion  
of a student itself has even changed over many years. In my twenty two years of   
life, I have most certainly not experienced everything there could be to know   
about being a student. However, I do feel that I  nevertheless have meaningful   
qualities to share. With the format of schooling having suddenly  changed due   
to extenuating circumstances, it can be incredibly difficult for students to  

adjust to their new way of schooling. Therefore, I now share the qualities of   
an Excellent Student that I  believe ring true regardless of format, situation,   
or time:

1. Organized
2. Curious
3. Responsible
4. Timely
5. Effort

These qualities separate Excellent Students from those around them and, I believe, are the primary
qualities that bring them academic success.

1. Excellent Students are **_organized_**.

 One of the most critical qualities of an Excellent student is that they are organized – and to
 this, there are two main components. The first is that Excellent Students’ academic performance is never impeded by a lack of organization. Many students are impeded by how they cannot locate certain notes, forget to take note of deadlines, or cannot organize their ideas / notes in a way that is later understandable to them. Excellent Students refuse to hold themselves back in this way. Secondly, Excellent Students’ organization in turn propels them into higher academic performance. In essence, this quality of an ES allows them to study, test, and perform the various duties of a student to their highest capacity.

2. Excellent Students are **_thorough_**.

 Excellent Students do not leave academic “stones” unturned. Their refusal to allow confusion to 
 remain confusion is where their excellency lies. Most students allow certain gaps in their understanding of the material to stay there, but Excellent Students make sure that they follow up on these gaps to learn more. This is a quality that allows them to dive deeper into the material that they are learning, to a far more comprehensive level than their peers.

3. Excellent Students are **_responsible_**.

 It is unlikely that any student will be on all cylinders, 100% of the time, completely enthused about schoolwork and their academic responsibilities. Many, if not all, students experience times where they simply do not want to study or work. During these times, Excellent Students distinguish themselves from others by how they remain responsible over their assignments and deadlines through these times. They maintain consistency, even when they aren’t completely happy about it. This quality shows a level of maturity over Excellent Students, who understand that although their level of joy regarding their work may fluctuate, their work should never mirror that.

4. Excellent Students are **_timely_**.

 Excellent Students are rarely, if ever surprised about deadlines. They know in advance when things will occur in any class, and never have to scramble to prepare for something that they were not anticipating. They never have the mentality of ‘It’s due later, so I can do it later’. They understand deadlines, and in fact have prepared in advance for contingencies and life’s wrenches. This way, they are able to adjust when unexpected situations occur.

5. Excellent Students show **_effort_**.

 Not every subject comes naturally to every student, and the expectation that every student can receive perfect grades on every class or subject they take, while a nice thought, is unrealistic. Excellent Students, regardless of their level of enjoyment in a class, or how naturally they seem to learn in a class, display a high level of effort in their work. Especially in classes where they do NOT enjoy the material, and do NOT learn the material naturally, they continue to show effort that shines through beyond what their resulting grade is. They understand the importance of showing the desire and struggle to learn in those situations. This distinguishes Excellent Students not necessarily in results, but by the internal growth that is displayed as they strive to learn in tough situations.
 
 These qualities are not easily attained but, over time, can be built up in a  
 person's daily life. I believe that they are worthwhile to working towards,  
 as they can aid in not just academic success, but many other areas of life.
